# Agent Working Rules

## Critical review

When reviewing a solution, do not just agree or optimize for the implementation. Always challenge the approach:

- What is the biggest hidden flaw?
- Where is this most likely to fail one year later?
- What assumptions are fragile?
- How can I validate this in practice?

Be direct, critical, and practical. Help avoid shallow thinking, over-engineering, hidden dependencies, and long-term maintainability problems.

## Before work

- Show a plan before any code or file changes.
- Trivial changes (single file, no API change, explainable in one sentence) are exempt: act directly, then self-check. When in doubt, show the plan.

## Communication

- Be direct about limits.
- If wrong, admit it directly.
- If unsure, say more research is needed.

# IsaacLab Guidelines

## Breaking API changes

- **Breaking changes require a deprecation first.** Do not remove or rename public API symbols without deprecating them in a prior release.

## API design rules (naming + structure)

- **Group by common prefix for discoverability (autocomplete).**
  - **Classes**: group by domain concept — `ActuatorNetLSTM`, `ActuatorNetMLP` (not `LSTMActuatorNet`, `MLPActuatorNet`).
  - **Methods**: group by noun before modifier — `set_joint_position_target()` (not `set_target_joint_position()`).
- **Method names are `snake_case`.**
- **CLI arguments are `snake_case`.**
- **Prefer nested classes when self-contained.**
  - If a helper type or an enum is only meaningful inside one parent class and doesn't need a public identity, define it as a nested class instead of creating a new top-level class/module.
- **Follow PEP 8 for Python code.**
- **Use modern Python type-hint syntax.**
  - Prefer PEP 604 unions: `x | y`, `x | None`. Do not use `typing.Union` or `typing.Optional`.
- **Use specific type hints for public interfaces.**
  - For torch tensors, annotate with `torch.Tensor`. For Warp arrays, annotate concrete dtypes (e.g., `wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3)`) rather than generic `object`.
  - Prefer consistent parameter names across base/override APIs (e.g., `xforms`, `scales`, `colors`, `materials`).
- **Use Google-style docstrings.**
  - Write clear, concise docstrings that explain what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.
  - Keep argument/return types in function annotations, not inline in docstrings.
  - In `Args:` entries, use `name: description` (not `name (Type): description`).
  - Use Sphinx cross-reference roles for symbol references (e.g. `:class:`, `:meth:`, `:attr:`, `:paramref:`), but keep targets as short as possible.
  - Within the same class/module, prefer short local references (e.g. `:meth:\`set_joint_position_target\``, `:attr:\`num_joints\``) over fully qualified paths.
  - If qualification is needed, prefer public API paths (e.g. `isaaclab.assets.Articulation`) and do not use internal `_src` or private module paths in Sphinx role targets.
- **State SI units for all physical quantities in docstrings.**
  - Use inline `[unit]` notation, e.g. `"""Particle positions [m], shape [particle_count, 3], float."""`.
  - For joint-type-dependent quantities use `[m or rad, depending on joint type]`.
  - For spatial vectors annotate both components, e.g. `[N, N·m]`.
  - For compound arrays list per-component units, e.g. `[0] k_mu [Pa], [1] k_lambda [Pa], ...`.
  - When a parameter's interpretation varies across solvers, document each solver's convention instead of a single unit.
  - Skip non-physical fields (indices, keys, counts, flags).
  - This rule applies to **public API docstrings only**, not test docstrings.
- **Keep the documentation up-to-date.**
  - When adding new files or symbols that are part of the public-facing API, make sure to keep the auto-generated documentation updated by running `./isaaclab.sh -d`.

## Dependencies

- **Avoid adding new required dependencies.** IsaacLab's core should remain lightweight and minimize external requirements.
- **Strongly prefer not adding new optional dependencies.** If additional functionality requires a new package, carefully consider whether the benefit justifies the added complexity and maintenance burden. When possible, implement functionality using existing dependencies, including Warp functions and kernels, NumPy, or the standard library.

## Tooling: prefer `./isaaclab.sh -p` for running, testing, and benchmarking

We use a wrapped python call within `./isaaclab.sh`.

- **Use `./isaaclab.sh -p -c` for inline Python**: When running one-off Python commands, use `./isaaclab.sh -p -c "..."` instead of `python3 -c "..."`.
- **Use `./isaaclab.sh -p`** to run standalone Python scripts without a `pyproject.toml` (e.g., in CI after switching to a branch with no project files).

### Run tests

```bash
# run all tests (extremely heavy, should be avoided).
./isaaclab.sh -t

# run a specific test file by name
./isaaclab.sh -p -m pytest PATH_TO_TEST

# run a specific example test
./isaaclab.sh -p -m pytest PATH_TO_TEST::METHOD
```

## Changelog

- **Do not edit `CHANGELOG.rst` or `config/extension.toml` directly.** Each PR adds a fragment file under `source/<package>/changelog.d/`; the changelog and version are compiled by the nightly CI workflow.
- **Add one fragment per touched package.** Pick any short, unique slug for the filename — your branch name (with `/` replaced by `-`) is a good default. The filename suffix declares the bump tier; within a batch the highest tier wins for the package.

  | Filename | Effect |
  |---|---|
  | `source/<pkg>/changelog.d/<slug>.rst` | patch bump |
  | `source/<pkg>/changelog.d/<slug>.minor.rst` | minor bump |
  | `source/<pkg>/changelog.d/<slug>.major.rst` | major bump |
  | `source/<pkg>/changelog.d/<slug>.skip` | no entry, no bump (CI / docs / test-only) |

- Use **past tense** matching the section header: "Added X", "Fixed Y", "Changed Z".
- Place entries under the correct category: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, or `Fixed`.
- Avoid internal implementation details users wouldn't understand.
- **For `Deprecated`, `Changed`, and `Removed` entries, include migration guidance.**
  - Example: "Deprecated `Articulation.A` in favor of `Articulation.B`."
- **Breaking changes** belong in `Changed`, prefixed with `**Breaking:**`.
- Use Sphinx cross-reference roles for class/method/module names.

### RST formatting reference

```
Added
^^^^^

* Added :class:`~package.ClassName` to support feature X.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed edge case in :meth:`~package.ClassName.method` where input was
  not validated, causing ``AttributeError`` at runtime.
```

Key formatting rules:
- Category heading: underline with `^` (carets), at least as long as the heading text.
- Entries: `* ` prefix, continuation lines indented by 2 spaces.

See `tools/changelog/test/integration/` for worked examples that double as integration-test fixtures.

## Git

Commit/push/branch/PR discipline lives in the `git-auto-sync` skill (`.codemaker/skills/tool/git-auto-sync/SKILL.md`) — run it at iteration close, before any commit or push.

## File headers and copyright

- New files must use the current year (2026) in the SPDX copyright header:
  ```
  # Copyright (c) 2022-2026, The Isaac Lab Project Developers (https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md).
  # All rights reserved.
  #
  # SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause
  ```
- Do not change the year in existing file headers.

## GitHub Actions and CI/CD

- Pin actions by major version tag (e.g. `actions/checkout@v6`). Use the same major version that other workflows in `.github/workflows/` already use — don't introduce a new major version without checking how it's used elsewhere.

## Testing Guidelines

- **Always verify regression tests fail without the fix.** When writing a regression test for a bug fix, temporarily revert the fix and run the test to confirm it fails. Then reapply the fix and verify the test passes. This ensures the test actually covers the bug.

### Debugging Warp kernels

**Do not add `wp.printf` to kernels in production code.** Debug prints in Warp kernels affect performance and can produce noisy test output. Use them only in standalone reproduction scripts during development, and always remove them before committing.

To debug Warp kernel behavior:

1. **Write a standalone reproduction script** and run it directly with `./isaaclab.sh -p -c "..."` or `./isaaclab.sh -p script.py`. This keeps stdout visible and avoids the test framework entirely.
2. **Use high-precision format strings** for floating-point debugging (e.g., `wp.printf("val=%.15e\n", x)`) — the default `%f` format hides values smaller than ~1e-6 that can still affect control flow.
3. **Remove all `wp.printf` calls before committing.**
